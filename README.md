# Project-3
Eleven is a clothing resale application designed to connect buyers and sellers of used clothing. The app will connect users and businesses alike to use as a platform to sell and keep track of inventory. It will be clean, simple and user-friendly. I would eventually like to create a business side of the application for brick and mortars to use in-store (ElevenXI).

My app, Eleven from what is out now as far as resale apps/websites in the sense that it is made for businesses and users alike. Keeping everything stream-line and in a “cloud” together. 
I also will be using queer-inclusive terminology when it comes to storing and searching. i.e. instead of “men” or “ladies” we will be using terms like “feminine” and “masculine”.

I currently am in an assistant-manager position in a local thrift store where we utilize social media for advertising and an inventory/pos system. I am hoping for the future of my application I can somehow make a simple easy way to connect everything and just make everything easier and simpler for businesses, customers and those who do resale as a side-hustle.


I have used in the past and researched different websites and apps like: Etsy, Depop and Reformation for ideas on how to incorporate my knowledge of resale with making a new user-end application.
